# Tanzu GPT: Python Edition

**Please note: This Application has been updated to work with the GenAI for TPCF tile versions 0.4.0 and higher.**
**You will need to update  INPUT_MODEL on the manifest.yml file to match a model you have deployed on the GenAI tile.**
**This assumes you are using ollama as a model provider**

This is a simple python sample application to be used in Cloud Foundry and Tanzu Application Service. It makes use of the new GenAI for TAS tile as well as the Tanzu Postgres tile to offer chatbot style workflows with full pgvector embedding support.

In order to get started with this application, query your Tanzu Application Service marketplace:

Tanzu GPT will require both a postgres database and LLM via GenAI for TAS to start correctly.

Provision these services:

Create a postgres database to use for pgvector embeddings - using the service name `tanzu-gpt-postgres`

~~~
 ~ cf create-service postgres on-demand-postgres-db tanzu-gpt-postgres
Creating service instance tanzu-gpt-postgres in org kuhn-labs / space homelab as admin...
OK
~~~

Create a service instance for the GenAI for TAS "shared-ai-plan" - using the service name `tanzu-gpt-genai-service`

~~~
 ~ cf create-service genai-service shared-ai-plan tanzu-gpt-genai-service
Creating service instance tanzu-gpt-genai-service in org kuhn-labs / space homelab as admin...

Service instance tanzu-gpt-genai-service created.
OK
~~~

Now that the services have been provisioned, go ahead and push the application.
